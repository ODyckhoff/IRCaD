When a basic, functional platform is complete upon which a game could reasonably be played, it will be labelled as Alpha and version numbering will start from 0.1. Updates to the code will be incremented as x.y.z+1, feature additions/overhauls will be incremented as x.y+1.z, and significant changes to inner workings and computational methods will be incremented as x+1.y.z.\r\n\r\nWhy C?\r\n======\r\n\r\nWell, why not? I chose C for its speed, robustness, and efficiency. Yes, it can be an arse to debug, but when I'm considering potential for many players to be playing possibly more than one game at once on a single application, non-blocking code and multi-threading needs to be as fast as I can get it, and C gives me the low level control that I need to ensure that memory is handled exactly the way I want it handled.\r\n\r\nAlso the application was originally being written in Perl, so consider yourselves lucky.\r\n\r\nDownloading/Running IRCaD\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this just yet, mainly because there's not an awful lot of substance to the codebase, but if you fancy running it, you're going to have to compile it the hard way as I've not yet created a Makefile.\r\n\r\nThis is partially because I can't be arsed and partially because I'm currently just developing, testing and debugging small components of the game, and haven't yet needed to be able to compile huge sections of the application all at once.\r\n\r\nI intend to have a set of Makefiles available, for compiling and testing smaller components, and then the big daddy Makefile that compiles the whole lot. This latter file probably won't exist until at least after pre-alpha.\r\n\r\nDesign\r\n======\r\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, the design hasn't yet entered a detailed phase, but you can see an overview of the components and how they'll interact here:\r\n\r\n![IRCaD Design Diagram](http://sconesorscones.co.uk/dev/IRCaD/IRCaD_Basic_Design.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
