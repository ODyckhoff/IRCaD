// Am making a brief overview of the items list, giving item IDs.
// Only weapons so far, this will allow the admins to 'give' at item to a player. 
// '/admingive 1 playerX' would give playerX item 1, a tree branch.
// The tree branch can be equipped by a warrior or a wizard, but the two are different IDs.

Format: 
ID | ItemCode | Name | Type | Material | Slot | ClassType | BuffCode

ID is an integer that applies to one item only.
ItemCode is a single letter, either W A or M. (weapon, armour, miscellaneous)
Name is a text field.
Type defines which subgroup of the ItemCode the item is in. (Longsword)
Material defines the rarity index of the type. (1)
Slot is where item is equipped. (Mainhand)
ClassType is a 2 letter code which allows a class to equip the item. (Wa) 
BuffCode determines whether an item has:
* set buffs when it spawns (y)
* a set number of randomly generated ones. (n0, n1, n2, n3)

So when making an iron longsword:
ID is 5, W for weapon, Iron Longsword is the name, longsword is the type, iron is the material, mainhand is the slot, 
wa is the classtype and the buffcode is n1, as it does not have set buffs and can be randomly assigned 1 buff.
