How IRCaD Version Numbers Work
------------------------------

All version numbers will be of the form x.x.x where x will be replaced by a number.

The third number will be incremented by 1 when:
    * Files are added to the repository (of any kind).
    * There are minor code updates (including trimming of unused code).
    * Documentation (including Configuration lists) is updated.
    * New functionality is created that abstracts trivial tasks.
    * Minor bug fixes and patches.

The second number will be incremented by 1 when:
    * Code updates result in a change in functional execution.
        - When new functionality is created that adds value to the software.
        - When updates change the overall structure of code in a file.
        - When functionality is replaced by, or moved to multiple functions.
    * Major bug fixes and patches. (E.g. in security flaws, or flaws that impair the running of the software)
    * New features are added.
    * Components are updated to use new libraries.

The 1st number will be incremented by 1 when:
    * Elements change that significantly affect the gameplay. (E.g. Implementing duelling between characters)
    * The codebase undergoes significant structural change.
        - This may be because the interaction of the system components had been completely redesigned.
        - Or because the codebase has undergone major revisions.
    * A significant change in the codebase results in backwards incompatibility.
